// ! THE JAVASCRIPT ENGINE

/* Let's explore the engine that allows JavaScript code to be run in our browsers and in Node.js. We'll take a look at Chrome's V8 engine */

/* Every browser has it's own engine that takes the source code we write and turns it into machine executable code. For Chrome, that engine is called V8. It is the same engine used in Node.js */

/* Chrome's V8 is written in C++ and the core of its job is to convert JavaScript in optimized machine code*/
